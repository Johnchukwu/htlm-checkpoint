          <h1><strong> 5 ways Tech can help your business :</strong></h1> 
        </div>
        
        <div class="lists1">
        <ol>
            <li>
               <strong>Measure User Engagement</strong> - In business environments, technology provides analytics tools, like Google Analytics, that business people can utilize
        to measure engagement. Such tools also offer statistical information to show ways to attract more customers. This can
        enhance conversion rates. Analytics tools can also be used to target a competitor’s audience and make better strategic
        business decisions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Secure Client Information</strong> - Being proactive about protecting customers’ information is a great way to save major time down the line. Frequent
                security breaches cause business disruptions and harm the company’s public image, making it much more difficult to
                attract customers. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the job outlook for information security analysts is
                very high at 33 percent, showing these skills are in high demand.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Improve Customer Service</strong> - Communication technology helps business professionals provide better customer service for products-based companies. You
                can easily attend to your customer’s complaints with chatbots and solve their issues.
                
                CRM systems also help in this regard as they improve communication between a business and its customers and enhance
                customer support. Mid-size businesses can also use their website and social media to engage their customers, communicate
                with them, and improve brand loyalty.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Enhance Business Agility</strong> - Technology also helps businesses respond to different changes in the market quickly. Businesses can integrate tech
                solutions that help them create better products. Technology can also streamline processes to make product launches
                faster, improve product features and come up with better innovations.
                
                Business solutions are easier to develop if you involve technology. This is especially important for startup businesses
                and smaller companies that have limited access to financial resources or have fewer employees.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Choose targeted technology solutions</strong> - The rapid evolution of technology has led to a seemingly endless number of products and solutions on the market. In a
                siloed company that walls off the IT department, team members have to make decisions based on relatively limited
                information. And each decision may solve only a single problem.
                
                When you implement technology as a business strategy, you can make technology choices from a broader perspective. You
                know what you are trying to do, you have data to drive your decisions and you can look for solutions that meet multiple
                needs all at once. With time to iterate, you can also take advantage of the advanced capabilities of a platform like
                Slack, building customized solutions rather than grabbing yet another product to solve a specific issue.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>Better Information Access</strong> - Today, if you want to find something out, it’s no more strenuous than a couple of clicks. For many of us, we don’t even
                need to move from the spot – simply pull out your phone and get Googling, or even ask your smart home assistant.
                
                It may seem like a distant memory, but it wasn’t so long ago that you’d have to take a trip to the library to find out
                more in-depth information about a subject, if it was available at all. Now, due to these advances in technology, you can
                find hundreds of thousands of web pages dedicated to pretty much anything you can dream of, from “crochet patterns”
                (Google gives 129,000,000 results) to “Roman history” (1,360,000,000 results).<br><br>

                It’s something of a cliche, but there is literally an app for anything, and they’ve rendered a lot of other mediums all
                but obsolete for many of us. Take GPS, for example – if you want to know how to get somewhere, it’s simply a case of
                pulling up an app like Google Maps and choosing the best route, which will come complete with directions, as well as
                satellite imaging. There are even apps for businesses that automatically route vehicles alongside traffic, weather,
                safety and legal information. App technology has also made learning, dating, dining, and almost anything else you can
                think of a lot easier for us.</li>


                <li><strong>Improved Communication</strong> -Thanks to lockdowns and social distancing, families and friends are meeting up and socializing via video call more than
                ever before. If you hadn’t heard of Zoom before 2020, you will have certainly become aware of it by now, and while there
                are plenty of other video conferencing apps out there, it’s Zoom that has emerged the poster child for video chat in the
                public consciousness. This is backed up by the firm's impressive claim of 300 million ‘daily participants’ earlier in
                the year, compared to ‘just’ 10 million back in December 2019.
                
                It’s not just social lives that have been transformed by video calls, either. The pandemic has also meant that more of
                us are working from home than ever, and in-person meetings have been replaced with video conferencing as office staff
                swap the boardroom for the bedroom (or wherever else they can find space to work at home).
                
                While Zoom is a great tool for catching up with buddies, can it do the job of supporting your business through the
                pandemic? We’ve evaluated several high-profile video conferencing systems and can help you find the right one for your
                company in minutes. </li> 


                <li><strong>Decreased Privacy</strong> - technology has also given us the tools to protect ourselves and ensure that we are safe as our lives migrate online. In
                2023, this is even more key – many of us are not only browsing for personal reasons, but accessing shared work networks
                from our own homes, and we can’t rely on the closed off security of the physical office. ager will protect your existing passwords, suggest new and secure ones, and in some cases, even monitor the web to
                ensure that your details aren’t compromised. Not only that, but it will do away with that ever-present fear we all have
                of forgetting one of our many, many passwords. If you don’t have one, there’s never been a better time to invest –plus,
                with some of the best apps only costing a few dollars a month, it’s a great low-cost solution for added security.</li> 


                <li><strong>Flexible Working</strong> - 2020 will be remembered for a lot of negative reasons, but one of its most defining positives has been the widespread
                acceptance of working from home. With the pandemic in full swing, many had to abandon their offices and log on from
                their own residences. At its peak, 42% of Americans were working from home, according to one study. And even once this
                pandemic has passed, the trend looks set to continue, with large companies such as Twitter and Microsoft already stating
                that their staff can work from home indefinitely.
                
                For many, working from home has been something of a revelation – no commuting, more flexible hours, a lessened
                environmental impact, and being able to choose where they work from. All this is made possible thanks to technological
                advancements, yet again – a perfect marriage of hardware and broadband.
                
                That’s not to say working outside the office doesn’t have its challenges – organizing employees who are spread across
                various locations successfully can certainly present problems. But yet again, our friend technological progress comes to
                the rescue, this time with remote working software, which can aid in organization, time management, goal focus and
                structure.</li>
                
                
                <li><strong>Smarter Health Tracking</strong> - Another trend in technology has been the rise of fitness devices. While we’ve been using tech to help us stay trim for
                many years now, we’ve never before been able to do it to such a scientific degree, with instant feedback and
                recommendations from devices that can monitor our workouts as we complete them.
                
                If you want to know how invested we are in the fitness tech market, look no further than Apple, whose Apple Watch is
                heavily advertised as a fitness device. In 2019, the company sold 31 million of them, making it the most popular watch
                brand in the world – far surpassing the likes of traditional brands like Rolex and Omega.
                
                So what can a fitness watch actually do? We’re far beyond the days when your “sports watch” could merely record your lap
                time. We now have the ability to monitor our heartbeats and blood pressure, track and monitor exercise plans, and even
                monitor our sleeping patterns.
                
                If you’re looking to buy one this year, Tech.co has reviewed and compared some of the best fitness watches out there –
                including FitBit, Apple Watch, and Garmin Forerunner – to find the best for features and budget.</li>
